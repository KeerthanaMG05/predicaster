# Predicaster 🌪⚠  
*AI-Based Disaster Prediction and Response System*

Predicaster is an intelligent web application that predicts natural disasters and facilitates timely response mechanisms. Using AI and data-driven models, it helps authorities and communities prepare for and respond to potential threats such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and more.

> 🔄 This version is a customized and enhanced version of a forked project, modified and maintained by *Keerthana M G*.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Python environment (if AI models are server-side)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/KeerthanaMG05/predicaster.git

cd client
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

> If you have a backend, run that separately using Python or Node.js as needed.

🧠 AI/ML Model Info

The system uses trained models to forecast:

Flood risk using rainfall, river data

Earthquake predictions using seismic patterns

Wildfire likelihood using temperature and vegetation data


> Model training scripts and datasets can be found in the ai-models/ directory (if applicable).
